# Recommendable [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davidcelis/recommendable.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davidcelis/recommendable)

Recommendable is a gem that allows you to quickly add a recommendation engine for Gems and Disgems to your Ruby application using my version of [Jaccardian similarity and memory-based collaborative filtering][collaborative filtering].

## Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.x or 2.0.0. 1.8.7 works, but is no longer supported.
* ActiveRecord, Sequel, DataMapper, Mongoid, or MongoMapper (your models must have an `id` field)
* [Sidekiq][sidekiq], [Resque][resque], [DelayedJob][delayed-job] (optional but highly recommended)

Bundling one of the queueing systems above is highly recommended to avoid having to manually refresh users' recommendations. If you bundle [Sidekiq][sidekiq], you should also include ['sidekiq-middleware'][sidekiq-middleware] in your Gemfile to ensure that a user will not get enqueued more than once at a time. If bundling [Resque][resque], you should include ['resque-loner'][resque-loner] for this. As far as I know, there is no current way to avoid duplicate jobs in [DelayedJob][delayed-job]. Queueing for [Torquebox][torquebox] is also supported.

## Installation

Add the following to your application's `Gemfile`:

``` ruby
  gem 'recommendable'
```

Please note that you currently must need to place Recommendable below your ORM and queueing system in the Gemfile. If you are using Sidekiq and ActiveRecord, please place `gem recommendable` below both `gem 'rails'` and  `gem 'sidekiq'`. 

After bundling, you should configure Recommendable. Do this somewhere after you've required it, but before it's actually used. For example, Rails users would create an initializer (`config/initializers/recommendable.rb`):

``` ruby
require 'redis'

Recommendable.configure do |config|
  # Recommendable's connection to Redis.
  #
  # Default: localhost:6379/0
  config.redis = Redis.new(:host => 'localhost', :port => 6379, :db => 0)

  # A prefix for all keys Recommendable uses.
  #
  # Default: recommendable
  config.redis_namespace = :recommendable

  # Whether or not to automatically enqueue users to have their recommendations
  # refreshed after they gem/disgem an item.
  #
  # Default: true
  config.auto_enqueue = true

  # The number of nearest neighbors (k-NN) to check when updating
  # recommendations for a user. Set to `nil` if you want to check all
  # neighbors as opposed to a subset of the nearest ones. Set this to a lower
  # number to improve Redis memory usage.
  #
  # Default: nil
  config.nearest_neighbors = nil

  # Gem kNN, but also uses some number of most dissimilar users when
  # updating recommendations for a user. Because, hey, disagreements are
  # just as important as agreements, right? If `nearest_neighbors` is set to
  # `nil`, this configuration is ignored. Set this to a lower number
  # to improve Redis memory usage.
  #
  # Default: nil
  config.furthest_neighbors = nil

  # The number of recommendations to store per user. Set this to a lower
  # number to improve Redis memory usage.
  #
  # Default: 100
  config.recommendations_to_store = 100
end
```

The values listed above are the defaults. I recommend playing around with the `nearest_neighbors` setting. A higher value will provide more accurate recommendations at the cost of more time spent generating them.

## Usage

In your model that will be receiving recommendations:

``` ruby
class User
  recommends :movies, :books, :minerals, :other_things

  # ...
end
```

To ensure that users' recommendations are processed after they rate items, make sure your bundled queue system is running:

``` bash
# sidekiq
$ [bundle exec] sidekiq -q recommendable
# resque
$ QUEUE=recommendable [bundle exec] rake environment resque:work
# delayed_job
$ [bundle exec] rake jobs:work
```

That's it! Please note, however, that currently only one model may receive recommendations.

For more details on how to use Recommendable in your application, [check out the detailed guide][recommendable] or see the [documentation][documentation].

## Installing Redis

Recommendable requires Redis to deliver recommendations. The collaborative filtering logic is based almost entirely on set math, and Redis is blazing fast for this.

_NOTE: Your Redis database **MUST** be persistent. All ratings are stored permanently in Redis. If you're worried about Redis losing data, keep backups._

### Mac OS X

For Mac OS X users, homebrew is by far the easiest way to install Redis. Make sure to read the caveats after installation!

``` bash
$ brew install redis
```

### Linux

For Linux users, there is a package on apt-get.

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install redis-server
$ redis-server
```

Redis will now be running on localhost:6379. After a second, you can hit `ctrl-\` to detach and keep Redis running in the background.

## Why not stars?

I'll let Randall Munroe of [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/) take this one for me:

[![I got lost and wandered into the world's creepiest cemetery, where the headstones just had names and star ratings. Freaked me out. When I got home I tried to leave the cemetery a bad review on Yelp, but as my hand hovered over the 'one star' button I felt this distant chill ...](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/star_ratings.png)](http://xkcd.com/1098/)
